# BDD Mode with Playwright-BDD

Auto-Browse seamlessly integrates with [playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd) to enable behavior-driven development. This integration allows you to write expressive feature files and implement steps using natural language commands.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install playwright-bdd
```

2. Configure `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from "@playwright/test";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
	testDir: "./features",
	use: {
		baseURL: "https://playwright.dev"
	}
};

export default config;
```

## Writing Tests

### Feature Files

Create Gherkin feature files to describe your test scenarios:

```gherkin
# features/homepage.feature
Feature: Playwright Home Page

  Scenario: Check title
    Given navigate to https://playwright.dev
    When click link "Get started"
    Then assert title "Installation"
```

### Step Definitions

Implement your steps using Auto-Browse's natural language commands:
Note, you only need one step definition for the `When` step, as it will handle all actions.
(It can be when, given or then either of one step)

```typescript
import { auto } from "@auto-browse/auto-browse";
import { Given, When as aistep, Then } from "./fixtures";

// Generic step that handles any natural language action
aistep(/^(.*)$/, async ({ page }, action: string) => {
	await auto(action, { page });
});
```

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to test a login flow:

### Feature File

```gherkin
# features/login.feature
Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given navigate to the login page
    When enter "user@example.com" in email field
    And enter "password123" in password field
    And click the login button
    Then verify dashboard is visible
    And check welcome message contains "Hello, User"
```

### Step Definitions

```typescript
import { auto } from "@auto-browse/auto-browse";
import { Given, When as aistep, Then } from "./fixtures";

// Generic step that handles any natural language action
aistep(/^(.*)$/, async ({ page }, action: string) => {
	await auto(action, { page });
});
```
