# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the complete installation and setup process for Auto-Browse.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Auto-Browse, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- A code editor (VSCode recommended)

## Package Installation

Install Auto-Browse using npm:

```bash
npm install @auto-browse/auto-browse
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @auto-browse/auto-browse
```

## ⚠️ Important: Playwright Version Requirements

Auto Browse requires Playwright version 1.53.0 or higher.

### Required Versions

```bash
"@playwright/test": ">=1.53.0"
"playwright": ">=1.53.0"
```

### Version Conflicts

If you're using Auto Browse alongside an existing Playwright setup, ensure you're using compatible versions. Here's how to handle common issues:

1. **Installation Conflicts**

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   This flag helps resolve peer dependency conflicts during installation.

2. **Multiple Playwright Versions**

   - Remove existing Playwright installations
   - Clear npm cache if needed: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Reinstall with the required versions

3. **Project Compatibility**
   - Update your project's Playwright configuration
   - Ensure your existing tests are compatible
   - Consider using a separate test environment if needed


## Verification

To verify your installation:

1. Create a test file (e.g., `test.ts`):

```typescript
import { auto } from "@auto-browse/auto-browse";

async function verify() {
	try {
		await auto("go to https://example.com");
		await auto("take a snapshot");
		console.log("Auto-Browse is working correctly!");
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error:", error);
	}
}

verify();
```

2. Run the test:

```bash
npx ts-node test.ts
```
