# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the complete installation and setup process for Auto-Browse.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Auto-Browse, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- A code editor (VSCode recommended)

## Package Installation

Install Auto-Browse using npm:

```bash
npm install @auto-browse/auto-browse
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @auto-browse/auto-browse
```

## ⚠️ Important: Playwright Version Requirements

Auto Browse currently requires specific versions of Playwright. This requirement will be relaxed in future versions.

### Required Versions

```bash
"@playwright/test": "1.52.0-alpha-1743011787000"
"playwright": "1.52.0-alpha-1743011787000"
```

### Version Conflicts

If you're using Auto Browse alongside an existing Playwright setup, you must upgrade to these specific versions. Here's how to handle common issues:

1. **Installation Conflicts**

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   This flag helps resolve peer dependency conflicts during installation.

2. **Multiple Playwright Versions**

   - Remove existing Playwright installations
   - Clear npm cache if needed: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Reinstall with the required versions

3. **Project Compatibility**
   - Update your project's Playwright configuration
   - Ensure your existing tests are compatible with the alpha version
   - Consider using a separate test environment if needed

> 🔄 Future releases will support a wider range of Playwright versions. Subscribe to our GitHub repository for updates.

## Environment Configuration

Auto-Browse requires configuration through environment variables for the Language Model (LLM) settings.

### Setting up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
```

### Environment Variables Reference

| Variable         | Description          | Default       | Required |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key  | -             | Yes      |
| `LLM_MODEL`      | The LLM model to use | `gpt-4o-mini` | No       |

## TypeScript Configuration

If you're using TypeScript (recommended), ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "ES2020",
		"module": "ESNext",
		"moduleResolution": "node",
		"esModuleInterop": true
	}
}
```

## Playwright Integration

While Auto-Browse can be used standalone, it's designed to work seamlessly with Playwright. If you plan to use it with Playwright tests:

1. Install Playwright:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

2. Configure Playwright with Auto-Browse:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
	use: {
		// Your existing Playwright config
	},
	// Recommended timeouts for AI operations
	timeout: 60000,
	expect: {
		timeout: 10000
	}
});
```

## Verification

To verify your installation:

1. Create a test file (e.g., `test.ts`):

```typescript
import { auto } from "@auto-browse/auto-browse";

async function verify() {
	try {
		await auto("go to https://example.com");
		await auto("take a snapshot");
		console.log("Auto-Browse is working correctly!");
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error:", error);
	}
}

verify();
```

2. Run the test:

```bash
npx ts-node test.ts
```
