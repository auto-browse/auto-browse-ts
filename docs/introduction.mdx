# Auto-Browse: True No-Code Browser Automation with AI

Auto-Browse revolutionizes browser automation by eliminating the need to write any automation code. Built on Playwright, it allows both technical and non-technical users to automate browser tasks and create maintainable test suites using plain English - no programming required.

## Why Auto-Browse?

- **One Universal Executor** - A single powerful AI engine replaces thousands of lines of automation code
- **Truly No-Code** - Write instructions in plain English, let our universal executor handle everything else
- **Revolutionary Simplicity** - One step executor runs all your automation tasks - no matter how complex
- **Zero Implementation Required** - No more writing or maintaining automation code
- **Universal Accessibility** - Anyone can create and maintain automations without coding skills
- **BDD Integration** - One step handles all your BDD scenarios
- **AI-Powered Adaptability** - Our universal executor dynamically adapts to UI changes

## How It Works
